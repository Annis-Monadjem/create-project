#####  Installation
yarn add project-creator

#####  Usage
After initializing your project, you can use the following scripts.

##### Runs the app in the development mode.
npm start

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will hot reload if you make edits.

##### Builds the app for production and files are saved to the build folder.
npm run build

It bundles your files in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

##### This command will build your app and start a server called serve which will serve your build files.
npm run build-serve
